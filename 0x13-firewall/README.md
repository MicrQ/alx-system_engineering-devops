# 0x13. Firewall

A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
It establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the internet, to prevent unauthorized access into or out of a computer network. Firewalls can filter unknown traffic and block outsiders from gaining access to private data.

This project is part of <b>ALX Software Engineering Program.</b> It is all about UFW(Uncomplicated FireWall) and how to set it up and running, how to prevent unauthorized access to a server, and more.....

## What I learned?
* How to install UFW on my web server(s).
* How to allow/deny access to the server(s).
